### 第一步：輸入課程

- 這件擴充功能是由課程來組織的. 第一步驟是在「課程」標籤內輸入您的課程.

  ![輸入課程](./data/setup1.jpg)

- 要輸入幾個課程？ 事實上，只需要輸入一個課程就可以，然後每門課再用這一個同樣課程。不過因為有些課之時間很密集，所以建議在擴充功能多輸入課程，免得兩堂課之間的學生有衝突。如果你認為比較整齊是給每一門課自己的擴充功能課程名稱，就可以。看你的方便。
- 調整教室的順序：拉一行往上下，請長按一行，然後給那行拉往上下
- 改一行文字的全部，請在文字框按三次（click 3 times)，然後這行文字全部會突出顯示。
- 新增一行：請按綠色的「+」按鈕
- 儲存資料：請按藍色的按鈕。
- 課程獨特名稱：每一間討論室必要獨特的名稱，不能重覆
- 課程刪掉：刪除一行是從行列的從最後面開始，若想把中間的行給刪掉，請拉下到最下面然後按紅色的按鈕就給最下面行刪掉
- 課程導出入是擴充功能資料的全部：導出入數據的按鈕是在最右邊黑色的按鈕。資料導出是為了個自己一個 backup，或許如果你有兩台電腦，能從第一胎電腦下載然後裝上去第二胎。**小心**：導入會重寫擴充功能資料的全部。

### 第二步：創建討論室

- 在討論時標籤內能創建討論室

  ![Enter rooms](./data/setup2.0.jpg)

- :smile: **最簡單的方法是給連結框框留著空白，不輸入任何的東西，然後儲存.** 這樣擴充功能會自動給你連結，這麼簡單.

  ![create rooms](data/setup2.1.jpg)

- **Google Classroom 老師**: 如果你是 google class room 老師，你的擴充功能「大教室」討論室是你的 google classroom “Meet Link".

  **只有 google classroom 老師需要做這個:** 請從你的 google classroom 主頁複製 meet link， 然後在擴充功能的 Main room 貼上。

  ![gc copy1](./data/GC-1.jpg)

  ![gc copy2](./data/GC-2.jpg)

- 連結的種類:

  - _暱稱（Nickname）_: 暱稱是動態的，因為每次使用 url 會創建新的連結。 暱稱是給付費 google 會員使用的，所以免費的使用者應該不會有這個功能。請注意暱稱需要獨特的名稱，免得兩位老師好一起用相同名字發生遇到同樣的 meet 連結裡面。

  - _代碼（Code）_: 代碼是連結的尾 12 字，比方說 https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij 的連結， 代碼是 abc-defg-hij. 這樣能輸入「abc-defg-hij」就可以。這個方法是不常用的。

  - _Meet 連結（Meet Url）_: 這是最常用的方法，留著空白就儲存，擴充功能會給你新的連結。如果你想全新的連結，就刪除留著空白儲存，擴充功能會給你新鮮的連結。

  - _普通連結（Resource Url）_: 任何的連結，比方說 youtube, 網站，等等.

### 第三步：調整設計

- 獨立視窗 / 視窗內的標籤: 挑選你想要的格式，獨立視窗或視窗的標籤。若選標籤的話，能制定在視窗頂多的標籤

  ![create rooms](data/setup3.jpg)

- 顏色: 挑選 meet 的下面工具欄有什麼顏色

- 讓外人自動進入：建議不要勾選，不然持著你教書連結的外人能夠自動闖入。不過如果你不擔心這個情況，就可以勾選。由你來決定，基本上建議不優勾選。

- 美好控制板的環境：在滑桿控制背景畫面與廣播背景畫面，可以選網路上的照片，換顏色，等等。

- 自動加入 meet. 首先，擴充功能只管理自己在「教室設定」標籤內輸入的連結，擴充功能不管「教室設定」外的 meet 連結。如果擴充功能看到在電腦有一個它要管理的連結，擴充功能會幫你按「立即加入」按鈕。如果你不想要自動加入，就可以把勾選給空白，不打勾。

- 不常用的方法，建議不要勾選：如果每次上課需要新的連結，就勾選大教室或討論室。在「快樂上課」標籤，「開始上課」區域內，按開啟大教室或討論室的按鈕時，擴充功能會自動給你新增的連結，並在「教室設定」標籤內輸入創新的連結。如果勾選「討論室」比較沒問題因為開課前沒有必要通知學生討論室的連結，但勾選「大教室」比較麻煩因為要開課前需要通知學生大教室的連結，不過若勾選「大教室」要先開啟大教室才知道這個大教室的連結是什麼。建議：如果不需要這個功能，請兩個都不給勾選，留著空白。

### 第四步: 調整 Meet 變更版面配置

-為了讓擴充功能看到你大教室所有學生，有一個 meet 設定，設定一次就可以，不用再管理它。

- 在截圖看到三個點按鈕，按一下，會有彈簧菜單出現，按「變更版面配置」。

  ![gm setting1](./data/setup4.1.jpg)

- 按「圖塊」，然後把「排顯示」的滑桿拉到最右邊的 49。

  ![gm setting2](./data/setup4.2.jpg)

### 第五步: 確認 Google 帳號

- 確認一下，顯示的帳號是你教書的 google 帳號，如果不是，請給它按一下。

  ![account-1](./data/meet-account1.jpg)

- Google meet 注意創新連結是從什麼帳號來的做，這樣 Google 認為該帳號是連結的主人。 如果你用了一個帳號創新連結，但換了帳號使用開啟的，Google 可能拒絕因為 Google 認為你並不是該連結的主人。

- 什麼是「主人」的帳號？ 是在你的電腦，**第一** 登入的 google 帳號。之後你能登入無限的帳號沒關係，主人的帳號還是你第一登入的 google 帳號。

- 如果發現「主人」帳號是錯，很簡單。按下面的藍色按鈕，全部登出，重新登入，注意第一個登入是你想要的主人帳號。

  ![account-2](./data/meet-account2.jpg)

### 第一步：選課與指定幾個分組

- 在「快樂上課」標籤，按「開始上課」就會出現：

  ![meet tab1](./data/use1.jpg)

- 在「課程」按鈕選你的課程，在幾個分組選你想要多少討論室。如果妳打開討論室後，決定要躲開討論室沒關係，就可以躲開，然後請按[重新視窗格式](#重新視窗格式) 整理好在螢幕上的試穿。

  ![meet tab2](./data/use1a.jpg)

### 第二步：開課

- 在「開始上課」區域有三個按鈕

  ![start class](./data/use2.jpg)

- 你可以按「大教室」打開只有大教室，或按「全部」打開大教室與討論室都有。
- 如果先按「大教室」單打開大教室，你能後來按「討論室」打開討論室。如果大教室已經開了，你按了「全部」按鈕請放心，大教室不會被打開了第二次。
- Google Classroom Teachers:
  - If you FIRST open the main room in the extension THEN open the google classroom meet link in your google classroom page, the main room is automatically linked.
  - However, most Google Classroom Teachers first open their google classroom link from their google classroom page by clicking on the "meet link" in the Stream or the icon in their Classwork. That's fine no worries. In this case, when you want to use the breakout extension, please click on the "Main Room" button in this extension to sync the extension with your google classorom page. When you click on the "Main Room" button you should see the tab for the main room to display "Main Room" which indicates everything is synced up correctly.
  - Also as a friendly reminder for GC teachers, in the [setup section step 2](#setup-2-create-breakout-rooms) you will have needed to copy your google classroom link into the Rooms tab as the Main room.
- During class you can change the number of breakout rooms, so please don't worry that you need to decide this ahead of time. If you increase the number of breakout rooms then when you click to open "Breakouts" the extension will only open the breakouts that are not yet open. For example, if you first start out the class with 3 breakouts and later decide to add 2 more, then you may change the number of breakouts to 5 and click Open Breakouts. Just those 2 unopened rooms will be opened.
- :warning: Please do not click on the checkbox "Low Memory Option" unless your computer has a very small amount of memory. If you check this box, then only one breakout room window will be displayed at a time. If you accidentally check this box, no worries. Just uncheck it and then choose your button option: Main, Breakouts, or Both
- :star: To reorganize your tiled windows, after they are opened please click on the red Re-tile button on the top right hand side of the control panel

  ![retile](./data/retile.jpg)

### 步驟 3A： 分組學生-臨時

- To assign students on an Ad Hoc basis please click on the button below:

  ![ad hoc](./data/adhoc0.jpg)

- Please make sure that you can see your students in the main room. In this example I only have 6 students.

- Also please remember to set your google layout to Tiled and 49 students, as described in [Change Google Meet Layout](#setup-4-change-google-meet-layout). You only need to do this setup once and google meet will remember this setting. If everything is OK then you should see a list of your students and the "Randomly Assign" button will appear.

  ![ad hoc 1](./data/adhoc1.jpg)

- Now you may click on the Randomly Assign button to shuffle the students among the groups. You may click the Random button as many times as you wish until you see a reasonable grouping. Also, you may drag and drop students between groups.

  ![ad hoc 2](./data/adhoc2.jpg)

- Next please click on the button below which will create a popup window.

  ![ad hoc 3](./data/adhoc3.jpg)

- In this popup window below, click on the first button to copy the Breakout Room Links and then please go to the Main room chat window and paste them in the chat box.
- Click on the second button to copy the Breakout Rooms Assigned Students list and paste them in the chat box.

  ![ad hoc4](./data/adhoc4.jpg)

- Paste the two lists (Breakout Rooms Links, and Breakout Rooms Assigned Students) into the chat window below. Google Meet has a 500 character limit on each paste so if the list is long then you may need to divide it up and paste in a couple of chunks.

  ![ad hoc5](./data/adhoc5.jpg)

- In this example, my rooms are 1, 2, and 3 so that is why the listing shows 1, 2, 3. If I had room names such as "Apple, Orange, and Banana" then the rooms listings would reflect these names, "Apple: ..., Orange: ..., Banana: ..."

- If you have not already done so, please remember to open the breakout rooms by clicking on the "Breakouts" button below. You may open the breakout rooms early, prior to assignment of students, if you want to.

  ![ad hoc6](./data/adhoc6.jpg)

### 步驟 3B： 分組學生-預先

- The instructions for assigning participants in the pre-assigned mode (i.e., from a MS word list you prepared before class) are described in the Meet tab, Assign Participants - Pre Assign section. If you follow those instructions you should be able to see all of your participants, assign then to groups, and copy/paste the links to the students in the Main chat. That section also describes how to trouble shoot if your students do not appear in that section

  ![3b](./data/use3b.jpg)

### 第四步：入出分組與操作視聽設備

- To move between rooms, please either click on the right or left arrows next to the slider or click on the blank space in the slider bar (the black portion). If you click on a blank space in the slider bar, the yellow dot will immediately move to that position.

  ![slider](./data/slider.jpg)

- When you move between rooms, the slider will automatically do the following muting:

  - In the current room:
    - Turn ON the speaker so the teacher can listen to the students in that room
    - Turn OFF the teacher's microphone to avoid disturbing the breakout discussion. To speak to the students, the teacher may click on that microphone button to toggle it on/off.
    - Turn OFF the teacher's camera to avoid disturbing the breakout discussion. To show the teacher's camera to the students, the teacher may click on that video button to toggle it on/off.
  - In all other rooms:
    - The speaker is turned off.
    - The teacher's microphone is turned off.
    - The teacher's camera is turned off.

- To avoid inconsistencies between the control panel and the individual meet windows, please use the audio visual buttons on the control panel rather than directly clicking the buttons in the individual meet windows. However, If the rooms and the control panel become out of sync, it is easy to get back in sync. Just click on the right arrow and then the left arrow to go right and left, then everything should be back in sync.

- Occasionally if the slider yellow dot on the slider is moved back and forth too quickly then the rooms can temporarily become out of sync. Multiple rooms may have their speaker, microphone, and video on. To get back in sync again, it's simple. Just click on the slider right arrow and then click on the left arrow slider. This will move you right and then left, syncing all the other rooms back to off, off, off for speaker, microphone, and slider.

- I typically move the slider by either clicking on the right and left arrows or by clicking on the slider "blank" spot which will make the slider immediately move to that spot. I have never experienced an out of sync problem using these two methods.

### 第五步：廣播系統

- Click on the broadcast speaker/microphone/video controls to broadcast into all of the breakout rooms.

  ![broadcast](./data/broadcast.jpg)

- Once you click on the slider either left or right, the broadcast will automatically be turned off and the normal mode of listening to the breakout room with muted teacher video and muted teacher microphone.

### 第六步：靜音和移除學生

- To mute the participants in a selected room, click on the mute button for the corresponding selection.
- To remove participants from a room, click on remove button for the corresponding selection.
- To remove participants and close the room click on the Class Over buttons

  ![mute](./data/mute.jpg)

### 隱藏顯示 Meet 下面的面板

- Sometimes the "real estate" space on your screen is too small, so you can toggle the google meet toolbar to hide or unhide, freeing up space

  ![hide](./data/hide.jpg)

- Click once to hide it, click again to unhide. In this way you can toggle the hide / unhide.

### 重新視窗格式

- This button will automatically re-tile all of your Google Meet Breakout Rooms windows - your main room and your breakout rooms.

  ![retile](./data/retile.jpg)

- This is super convenient because now you can move windows around, resize them, place one on top of the other and then with a single click on the "Re-Tile" button all the windows will snap back into place, in their original order. Also, teachers may first open the main room and then open the breakouts. With the "Re-tile" button all the windows are tiled together so you can at a glance see all of them. In other cases, during class the teacher may decide to add or close breakouts. With a single click on the "Re-tile" button all the rooms are tiled together.

### 縮小放大控制板

- The control panel is the cockpit where the teacher has a large number of features and functions to manage the session. However, the control panel takes up valuable real estate on the screen and can often get in the way. Click on the Minimize/Maximize button to toggle between the full size and minimized size.

  ![minmax](./data/minmax.jpg)

- Once the rooms are all open then the teacher may minimize the control panel and just use the slider to move between rooms. Please note that ALL of the features of the full-size control panel are still available in the minimized state. All the teacher has to do is scroll down to see the rest of the functions, such as broadcast as one example.

### 簡報

- Click on the "Reports" button in the "Meet" tab to find a list of basic reports. They are copied to the clip board and are downloaded to your computer if the checkbox is checked.

  ![report](./data/reports.jpg)

### 導出入數據

- There are export/import of breakout room within the "Rooms" tab.

  ![room-download](./data/rooms-export.jpg)

- **Most common usage:** To copy the entire project, all of the courses and all of the breakout rooms, choose the export/import option within the "Courses" tab. Teachers export the extension file data in order to back it up in the event needing to uninstall / re-install the extension or to copy the breakout room extension data to another one of their computers.

  ![courses-download](./data/courses-export.jpg)

- The export file is a very small text file which contains the breakout rooms links, courses, and settings. It will be downloaded into your pc's download folder.

  ![export-popup](./data/export-popup.jpg)

### Do my students need to install this extension?

- No. Only the teacher needs to install the extension.
- Please do not ask your students to install the extension because it is not necessary for them and it may confuse them having an extra unneeded extension on their computers.

### How much memory (RAM) do I need to run the extension?

- Normal Mode: In the "normal" mode where you open up all the breakouts simultaneously in either tab or tile mode, most teachers report that they need about 16G RAM to open more than a few rooms, such as 10. In the normal mode, please do NOT check the checkbox in the Meet tab, Sart Class section.

- Low Memory (RAM) Mode: Video Demo In the "low memory mode" mode even a tiny computer such as a chromebook should be able to run and manage a very large number of breakouts, such as 50. Theoretically it is unlimited because only one breakout room is displayed on your computer at a time. Even though all the rooms are "open", your computer will display them one by one using the slider control For additional help on this option please click on the red Help in the checkbox text.

### Why is the extension not working properly?

- This may happen for a number of reasons. One reason is that a new version of my extension was not updated completely on your system. One way to force a restart of your extension is to go to your chrome browser, window menu, select extensions. Find this extension and then turn the slider off, wait 3 seconds, then turn the slider back on again. This does not delete your data. It is similar to restarting your computer but for your extension
- Other things you may try are Refresh the control panel (command/control r) and Refresh the window (command/control r)
- Another reason the extension may not work properly is that Google from time to time updates their google meet application which can cause conflicts with my extension. If that happens, or if you suspect something like that has happened to you and your fellow teachers, then please notify me so that I may fix it as soon as possible. My email is robert@hudektech.com.
- If you feel like you need to uninstall the extension please first export your data so you don't have to re-enter it. First go to the Courses tab, far right hand side black button Export your data. After you uninstall the extension and re-install it, you may import your data. Import your data through the Courses tab and enter your file name.

### Why can't I see any students in the Assign Participants section?

- The main reason you cannot see any students in the Assign Participants section is likely because your display of Google Meet does not have any students in it. The students icons need to be visible in the meet window in order for the extension to see them to put them in the assign participants section.

- If you are a Google Classroom teacher please make sure your Google Classroom meet is in sync with the Main room, by ensuring that the link is your Main room in the Rooms tab and you clicked on the open Main Room button to sync it up.

- Please remember that if a link was created by another user, or by yourself but under a different google account name, then you may not be able to open that link. Google by default uses the Primary Account to open the meet links. The primary account is the FIRST account that you use to login to your computer with. You can view this primary account in the Rooms tab and also in the Meet tab. If it is not your correct account then unfortunately you will need to log out of all your google accounts and then re-log in keeping in mind your first login is your primary account (school account).

### Why can't I see all of my students?

- It is likely because your display is not tiled and not set to 49. Please click on the triple dot button on the bottom of your google meet and then select "Change Layout", then click on the radio button for the "Tiled" format, then click on the slider in that popup to push it to 49. Now you can view 49 students in a tiled format on the screen which should be plenty large enough for assigning participants.

### Does this extension work with co-teachers?

- Yes it does. Here is a video that explains how you can use this extension in a teaching environment
  [co-teachers](https://youtu.be/6Z_b4aWHrvY)

### Do students need to leave the main room?

- The short answer is no they do not need to leave the main room. When I teach using this extension most of my students stay in the main room as well as open their assigned breakout room. In that case they are simultaneously in two rooms, the main room and their assigned breakout room. The only time that is a problem is if a student forgets and leaves their microphone on in the main room, because then it would cause feedback to the other rooms.

- On occasion I would have to ask them to please mute their mic in the main room or I can actually mute it for them using the Room Participants Control section "Mute All Participants" button. Please also remember that if you as the teacher have your microphone on in the main room and speak, that will be heard in all the students main room which feeds back in to their breakout rooms (if they have 2 windows open, their main and their breakout room).

- The good news is that if you use the slider you should never accidentally have your microphone on in multiple rooms because the slider automatically mutes all the other rooms and only turns on the microphone in the current slider positioned room. The only time your microphone would be on in multiple rooms is if you either manually turn on the microphone in the room itself (not going through the control panel) or if the slider gets out of sync which may happen if you grab the yellow dot and move it directly. I recommend using the arrows or clicking in a blank position the slider bar. If your slider does get out of sync it is very easy to get back in sync - just click on the right arrow and then the left arrow to reset everything.

- I usually will make a broadcast announcement 5 minutes prior to closing of the breakouts, and when time is up I will also make a broadcast announcement asking them to leave their breakouts and "go back" to the main room. The "go back" is in quotes here because most are already in the main room as well, they never left it. However, some students do leave the main room and then re-enter the main room when they leave the breakouts. I never noticed any difference in the teaching experience, so I let the students do it either way: 1) exit the main room and go to the breakouts or 2) still stay in the main room but also go to the breakout. You may have a different experience so feel free to manage it whichever way you feel best.

### How can I close the breakouts?

- There are several ways to close the breakouts when time is up, however, you should first make sure that all the students have left the room. I believe for the teachers google suite there is a 40 second time requirement where the room must be completely vacant for 40 seconds before you can safely close it and no students may re-enter the room. If you need to control the room and not allow students to meet on their own in these breakouts, then you will need to wait at least 40 seconds before you close it.

- Please note that I am not 100% sure of this 40 second window described above. This is just what I heard and read on Google Meet forums. I advise everyone to test this out for themselves if this is important to you.

- You may close the breakout rooms directly by closing the window like any other window or you can click on the "Close Room" button in the Room Participants Control section. If students are lingering and not leaving after you asked them to, you may remove them using the "Remove All Participants" button. After they are removed (and you wait more than 40 seconds if you need to ensure they cannot re-enter) then you may close the room

### How can I simulate students to practice using the extension?

- If you have a Google suite account then you can create simulated students by using Chrome incognito and enter any name you choose. If you do not have a Google suite account then you will need to use (extra) Google accounts to simulate students

### How can I use this extension on multiple computers?

- Use the export/import option in the "Courses" tab to download your data from your first computer. Go to your second computer and import this file. Now the two computers are in sync
